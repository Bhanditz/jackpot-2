* TODO

** To first version
 - Handle a payment
 - Subscriptions (plans and stuff) (OK)
 - Handle recurring payments (billing each day 1 of the month)

** Later version
 - Prorating the payment


** It won't ever do
 - Record clients cards information
** Nice to have
 - Setup a heroku demo project with fake credentials
 - Admin dashboard to control payments
 - API to be integrated with 3rd party apps (CRM and stuff)


** General ideas
 - This app will be some sort of framework for handling payments. So,
   it is expected from users, they extend this framework via plugins
   or 3rd party code to handle payments.
